    <h1>Using Quotation and Citation tags in HTML</h1>
    <p >Here is a famous quote by Albert Einstein:</p>
    <blockquote><q> life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.</q> <b>//this is a blockquoted text</b></blockquote>
    <p>In the context of this discussion, one might say: <b>//this is paragraph</b></p>
    <q>To keep your balance, you must keep moving.</q>  <b>//this is quoted text</b>
    <p>This quote is widely attributed to <cite>Albert Einstein.</cite><b>//this is a citation tag.</b></p>
    <p>In literary studies, it's essential to cite sources properly. For example, if you're referencing a famous work like <i>Pride and Prejudice</i><b>//this is a citation tag.</b><br>by Jane Austen, you should always include the author's name to give proper credit.</p>
    <p>Another classic example can be seen in <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite><b>//this is a citation tag.</b>  <br>by William Shakespeare, where love and tragedy intertwine to create a timeless story.</p>
